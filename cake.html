                </br>
                    1 large egg
                    ½ cup natural sun butter OR ⅔ cup pumpkin puree
                    ¼ cup vegetable or canola oil
                    1 tsp pure vanilla extract
                    3 TBS honey or 100% pure maple syrup
                    1 cup whole wheat flour
                    1 tsp baking soda
                    1 cup food-processed carrots
                </p>
                <p>
                   <bold>FROSTING</bold>
                </br>
                    ½ cup natural sun butter OR plain mashed potatoes
                    ½ cup plain Greek yogurt
                </p>
                <p>
                    <bold>INSTRUCTIONS</bold>
                </br>
                    Preheat oven to 350F.  Grease a 6-inch round cake pan and set aside.
                    If Using Pumpkin Puree: heat pumpkin over medium heat, stirring frequently, until pumpkin has reduced and looks thick.  Let cool and measure out ½ cup to use in recipe.
                    In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the egg, pumpkin or sun butter, oil, vanilla extract, and honey or maple syrup.
                    In second bowl, stir together the flour and baking soda.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just combined.  Fold in the carrots.  The batter will be thick - using a hand mixer is helpful.
                    Transfer batter to prepared pan and spread flat.  Bake for about 30 minutes until the edges just start to pull away from the pan.  Let cool and remove from pan.

                </br>
                    4 strips bacon
                    ½ cup (122g) pumpkin purée
                    1 large egg
                    2 cups + 2 Tablespoons (323g) whole wheat flour all-purpose is fine; be sure to measure properly
                    ½ Tablespoon baking powder
                    2 to 4 Tablespoons (30-60mL) water or milk
                </p>
                    <bold>INSTRUCTIONS</bold>
                </br>
                    Preheat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Set aside.
                    Cook the bacon by your desired method until fully cooked. Remove the cooked bacon, place it on a plate or cutting board to cool a bit, then pour off the bacon grease into a medium size bowl.
                    Coarsely chop the bacon, then add it to the bowl of bacon grease. Add the pumpkin and the egg and whisk until smooth. Set aside.
                    In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder.
                    Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix gently until everything is combined. Add about ½ to 1 Tablespoon of water or milk at a time until dough stays together (I usually wind up adding about 2 to 4 Tablespoons total). You will likely need to use your hands.
                    Turn out dough onto a floured surface and roll out to approximately ¼" thick. Use desired shape cookie cutter, reroll, and cut again until there is no more dough left. Bake dog treats for 30 minutes, flipping treats over halfway through baking. Store dog treats covered at room temperature. Treats may be frozen, up to 3 months. Thaw at room temperature.

                    Form balls based on the size of your pet.
